# PacMen Exercise
## In this excercise, the PacMan moves and when it touches the border of the page, it will reverse the direction(the image will change). The PacMan also opens and closes it mouth as it moves. This project was created under <a href="https://github.com/rhdpd/Eye/blob/main/License"> MIT License </a>

### You can view the PacMan animation <a href="https://rhdpd.github.io/PacMen/"> PacMan </a>

ðŸ”® Future ideas - I would like to add multiple pacman with different color and potential integrate with server to have user insert their choice of pacman image.
